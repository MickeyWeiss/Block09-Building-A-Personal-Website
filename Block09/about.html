        <h3>World Traveler</h3>
        <p>In my travels I have enjoyed galavanting around Europe, South America and the Middle East.</p>
        <div>Traveling has always been one of my greatest passions. In my previous life, working to facilitate the importation of cut flowers from South America to the United States, I was privilaged enough to make many sojourns to Colombia and Ecuador. I have also toured around Europe, Israel, the Caribbean and over 40 of the United States.</div>
